# Synchronous-FIFO-with-Write-and-Read-logic

FULL & EMPTY FLAG GENERATION
FIFO full and almost full flags are generated by Write Control Logic whereas empty and almost empty flags are generated by Read Control  Logic.
FIFO almost full and almost empty flags are generated to intimate thesource and the requestor about impending full or empty conditions. Thealmost full and almost empty levels are parameterized.It is important to note that read and write pointers point to the same memorylocation at both full and empty conditions. Therefore, in order todifferentiate between the two one extra bit is added to read and write pointers. For example if a FIFO has depth of 256 then to span it completely8-bits will be needed. Therefore with one extra bit read and write pointers
