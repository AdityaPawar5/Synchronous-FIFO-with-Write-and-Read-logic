FULL & EMPTY FLAG GENERATION<br/>
FIFO full and almost full flags are generated by Write Control Logic whereas empty and almost empty flags are generated by Read Control  Logic.
<br/>FIFO almost full and almost empty flags are generated to intimate thesource and the requestor about impending full or empty conditions. <br/>The almost full and almost empty levels are parameterized.
<br/>It is important to note that read and write pointers point to the same memory location at both full and empty conditions. 
<br/>Therefore, in order todifferentiate between the two one extra bit is added to read and write pointers. 
<br/>For example if a FIFO has depth of 256 then to span it completely8-bits will be needed. 
<br/>Therefore with one extra bit read and write pointers will be of 9-bits. When their lower 8-bits point to same memory location their MSBs are used to ascertain whether it is a full condition or emptycondition. 
<br/>**In empty conditions the MSBs are equal whereas in full condition MSBs are different.** 
<br/>The verilog code shown below depicts the same:
<br/>**assign fifo_full = ( (write_ptr[7 : 0] == read_addr[7 : 0]) &&(write_ptr[8] ^ read_ptr[8]) );**
